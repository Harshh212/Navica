# Google Gemini AI Integration (FREE) ðŸ¤–

## Overview
NAVICA now uses **Google Gemini AI** (completely FREE) to generate personalized career improvement suggestions for job seekers. This replaces the OpenAI integration and requires no credit card or payment.

## Why Gemini?
- âœ… **100% FREE** - No credit card required
- âœ… **60 requests per minute** - More than enough for your needs
- âœ… **High quality** - Comparable to GPT-3.5
- âœ… **Perfect for college projects** - Professional AI without costs
- âœ… **Easy setup** - Get API key in 30 seconds

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Your FREE Gemini API Key
1. Visit: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the key (starts with `AIzaSy...`)

### 2. Add Key to Environment
The key is already configured in `backend/.env`:
```properties
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyDs2GaEbPp0jI9O27ciRUk-glAdNm6cV14
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Already installed:
```bash
pip install google-generativeai
```

### 4. Start Server
```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```

## How It Works

### Code Architecture
1. **Function**: `generate_gemini_improvement_suggestion()` in `agent_core.py`
2. **Model**: Uses `gemini-pro` (Google's most capable free model)
3. **Fallback**: If Gemini fails, uses rule-based suggestions
4. **Integration**: Called during job analysis for each job posting

### Example Flow
```python
# For each job analyzed:
suggestion = generate_gemini_improvement_suggestion(
    user_skills=["Python", "Django", "React"],
    matched_skills=["Python", "Django"],
    missing_skills=["AWS", "Docker"],
    job_title="Backend Developer"
)
```

### Prompt Engineering
The function sends this context to Gemini:
- **Job Title**: What position they're applying for
- **Candidate's Skills**: All skills from their resume
- **Matched Skills**: Skills they have that the job needs
- **Missing Skills**: Skills the job requires that they lack

Gemini responds with:
- Acknowledgment of their strengths
- Specific advice on developing missing skills
- Learning resources (courses, projects, certifications)
- Motivational guidance

## Example Outputs

### Before (Rule-Based)
> "Great match! Your expertise in Python, Django aligns well with this role. To strengthen your application, consider developing skills in AWS, Docker. Focus on hands-on projects or certifications in these areas to stand out."

### After (Gemini AI - FREE)
> "Your strong foundation in Python and Django positions you well for this Backend Developer role. To enhance your profile, I recommend gaining hands-on experience with AWS through their free tier and completing Docker's official tutorials. Consider building a containerized project and deploying it on AWS to showcase both skills simultaneously - this practical approach will make your application stand out significantly."

**Solution**: Free tier has 60 req/min - wait 1 minute or get new API key

### Issue: Fallback to rule-based suggestions
**Check**:
1. Is `GEMINI_API_KEY` set in `.env`?
2. Is the key valid? (Test at https://makersuite.google.com)
3. Check terminal logs for specific error messages

## Verification

Test that Gemini is working:

1. Open browser: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
2. Upload your resume
3. Search for "Software Engineer" jobs
